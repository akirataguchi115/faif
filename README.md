# FaiF 3.0 
Free as in Freedom is a book about the life of Richard Stallman written by Sam Williams in 2002.

Free as in Freedom 2.0 is a revised edition by Stallman perself in 2010.

Free as in Freedom 3.0 is a progressive collection the revised edition of 2010 in multiple languages (English, Finnish, Indian, etc.) on multiple formats (.epub, audiobook formats, written/published by a publisher). This project will act as the central communication point of all things FaiF. Should this project fall apart somehow, we plead the next project to be named 4.0 or something distinguishing from the our possible failure.

We seek to spread the word of software freedom in as many languages as possible and as many formats, ebook/audiobook sellers (Audible, Kindle, etc.) as possible.
